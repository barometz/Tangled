Abandoned! For now, at least.  The concept is promising and has been done 
successfully before, but a more practical solution has been found in Shirk, 
which can be found in this same user's repository.

Tangled is a modular IRC bot that talks to modules (or nodes, as they are
called henceforth) by a python interface or through plain-text stdio pipes.
It will be, anyway.  It is currently far from done and only barely functional,
but it's here and the outlines are pretty clear.

Tangled makes use of the Twisted "event-driven networking engine", which can
be found at <http://twistedmatrix.com/>.  It is currently tested with Twisted
11.0.

See DESC for vague details on how stuff works, tangled.org for future plans
and tangled.py if you just want to dive in.
