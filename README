Tangled is a modular IRC bot that talks to modules by a python interface or
through plain-text stdio pipes.  It will be, anyway.  It is currently far from
done and only barely functional, but it's here and the outlines are pretty
clear.

See DESC for vague details on how stuff works, tangled.org for future plans
and tangled.py if you just want to dive in.
