* Core functionality
** DONE Move logging back to the modules so the source shows up right
** TODO Cleanup
*** Renaming stuff to sensible names
*** Coding conventions (PEP 8 plz)
** TODO Executable mods (need testing)
*** TODO two-way comms via twisted.
    Specifically, the abilty to have a python plugin run as an executable
    and give it two pipes - one to talk to the core, one to talk to irc or
    whatever.  twisted.internet.stdio theoretically should do that
** Python mods
   Less suitable for modules with blocking bits because it's not threaded.
   The irc module is only there because I haven't figured out how to use
   twisted.internet.stdio,
*** DONE Stick the interface in a separate module or something
** DONE Interface via json

* Modules
** jiggly
** conversation trees (maybe, but probably just coding that into jiggly)
** cron
*** http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/time.html
** irc
*** TODO Hooks
**** !commands
**** join
**** part
**** arbitrary message matches
**** privmsg
**** message specific to channel?
*** DONE Configuration file
**** Nickname
**** Server
**** Port
**** nickserv pass
**** channels
**** TODO encoding
*** TODO Pending requests queue
*** TODO Specific requests (user's host, full whois data, user modes, etc)
   
** Logging.  In irc.py or separate?
** Authentication/Authorization
*** Nickserv
**** How much do the common implementations vary?
**** What's the easiest way to figure out whether someone's ID'd?
     Apparently Nickserv sends a numerical status code on /msg nickserv
     status <nick> (thanks frowardd!) but freenode does things differently
     Oh hey, on Freenode nickserv ACC serves the same purpose
*** Ops/hops/voice
*** Hostmask-based
**** Of course, require a cloak

* Other
** DONE Proper checking of config values
** Documentation
** DONE Decide on a VC system (git?)
** DONE Decide on a license
**** Stick it in all files!
